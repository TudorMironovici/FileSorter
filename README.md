**This is a simple app for sorting files.**
- V1 (current) only sorts based on filetype

**Exmaple:**

You have a bunch of .pdf, .txt, and .docx files in a directory. This app will read through your directory and move all the .pdf files in a 'pdf' sub directoy, all the .txt files in a 'txt sub directory, and all the .docx files in a 'docx' sub directory.

You do not have to provide an explicit list of file types or create the sub directories beforehand. It's smart enough to do that on its own :)


**How to use the app:**
- You can plop the app in any directory and it will sort out everything in there
- If you wish to have multiple directories sorted at the same time, you can create a "FileSorter.config" file in the same directory as the app, where the config file lists each desired directory on an individual line
